# Dungeoneer
Android Studio Text Based Adventure App

A Java text-based adventure game, modified to a basic GUI in android studio, demonstrating the use of game mechanics interacting with real time user input.

# Android Studio and Java Project: Dungeoneer
This is my second full project at CodeClan. I had a week to build an app, in either android studio or java. I chose instead to integrate a game I created in my spare time over Christmas, into Android Studio. In order to prove it was possible, and for me to make a tutorial for new players to the genre of Tank, Healer, DPS based games.


**Getting Started**

Clone the project to your machine and open in Android Studio. With a standard sized mobile phone emulator running you should be able to open and run the game, nothing else necessary.

**Prerequisites**
Android studio

**Built With**

Android Studio and IntelliJ
